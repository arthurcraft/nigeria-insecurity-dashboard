An open-source Progressive Web App (PWA) providing real-time data, geospatial mapping, and trend analysis on security incidents across Nigeria. This tool is designed to empower journalists, humanitarian workers, researchers, and policymakers with actionable intelligence to foster understanding and drive solutions.

## The Mission

In a complex security landscape, access to clear, timely, and well-contextualized data is critical. The Nigeria Insecurity Dashboard aims to bridge the information gap by aggregating data from reliable sources (like ACLED) into a single, accessible, and offline-capable interface. Our goal is to provide a public good that supports evidence-based reporting, policy-making, and humanitarian response efforts.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Geospatial Map:** Visualize conflict hotspots with a heatmap layer and drill down into district-level data using Leaflet.
*   **Dynamic Timeline:** Analyze trends in violence over time, with a focus on election cycles and seasonal patterns.
*   **Regional Breakdown:** Compare incident density and lethality across Nigeria's geopolitical zones.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Explore the interconnected drivers of insecurity, from economic pressures to governance failures.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on any mobile device for an app-like experience and **full offline access** to the last-loaded data.
*   **Open Source:** Built with React and licensed under MIT, inviting community contribution and ensuring transparency.
